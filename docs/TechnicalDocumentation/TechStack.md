# Technical Documentation: Technology Stack

## Overview

HercuHealth uses a MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This stack is chosen for its efficiency, scalability, and the cohesive development experience it offers, especially for a full-stack JavaScript application.

## Frontend

### React (Client)

- **Purpose**: Used for building the user interface of HercuHealth.
- **Key Features**: Interactive UI, component-based structure, efficient state management.
- **Tools/Libraries**: React Router for navigation, Redux or Context API for state management, Axios for API calls.

## Backend

### Node.js & Express.js (Server)

- **Purpose**: Server-side logic, API management, interaction with the database.
- **Key Features**: Fast, scalable, efficient for handling asynchronous requests.
- **Tools/Libraries**: Express.js for routing and middleware, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for authentication.

## Database

### MongoDB

- **Purpose**: Storing user data, workouts, and program details.
- **Key Features**: Schema-less, scalable, flexible for varied data structures.
- **Data Modeling**: Collections for users, workouts, and programs. Relationships and data normalization strategies.

## Authentication

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

- **Purpose**: Securely handling user authentication and sessions.
- **Implementation**: Token generation upon login, token verification on protected routes.

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS

- **Purpose**: Styling the frontend of the app.
- **Key Features**: Utility-first, responsive design, customizable.

## Conclusion

This stack was chosen for its robustness and suitability for a scalable, full-stack web application. It offers a streamlined development process with JavaScript as a single language across both the client and server sides.
