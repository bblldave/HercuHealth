# Application Deployment Instructions

## Overview

This document outlines the steps for deploying HercuHealth to a production environment.

## Preparing for Deployment

- Ensure all code is tested and stable.
- Update environment variables for the production environment.
- Optimize the build for the client and server.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Client Deployment:**

   - Build the React application for production:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - Deploy the build folder to a static hosting service or a cloud provider.

2. **Server Deployment:**

   - Choose a cloud provider or hosting service (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
   - Set up a Node.js environment on the server.
   - Deploy the server code and start the application.

3. **Database:**
   - Set up MongoDB in a production environment or use a managed MongoDB service.
   - Ensure database security and proper access controls.

## Post-Deployment

- Regularly monitor the application for performance and errors.
- Set up a process for continuous deployment and integration for future updates.

## Conclusion

Deployment processes might vary based on the chosen hosting services and cloud providers. Ensure all environments are properly configured for security, performance, and scalability.
